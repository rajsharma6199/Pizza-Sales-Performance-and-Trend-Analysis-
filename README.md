# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project (MySQL & Power BI)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales performance using **MySQL** for data processing and **SQL** for generating key business insights. The derived tables are ready for export and visualization in **Power BI**.

## 📁 Main Dataset

| File Name | Description | Imported Table |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pizza_sales.csv` | Contains detailed pizza sales data including order details, pizza category, size, quantity, and total price. | `pizza_sales` |

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Standardization

The raw data was processed in MySQL with the following steps:

1. **Disabled `SQL_SAFE_UPDATES`** to allow updates on the dataset.
2. **Standardized Pizza Sizes:** Converted abbreviations to readable names:
    * `S` → `Regular`
    * `M` → `Medium`
    * `L` → `Large`
    * `XL` → `X-Large`
    * `XXL` → `XX-Large`
3. **Time-based Feature Engineering:** Extracted the day name from `order_date` using `DAYNAME()` and stored it in a new column, `order_day`.
